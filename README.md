Because rundeck isn't cool enought for me


Before using some cimplicated tools I need a simple tool to run the same pattern of script to different machines.

like 
    
    ssh user@host stop-service.sh
    ssh user@host update-migrate-whatever.sh
    ssh user@host start-service.sh
    
    sudo make me a sandwich

And you do this for multiple servers.
I think this looks great for prototyping and non-ops/puppet/chef/ansible people like me.
